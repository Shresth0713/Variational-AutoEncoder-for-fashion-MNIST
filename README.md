# Variational-AutoEncoder-for-fashion-MNIST
This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. Unlike a traditional autoencoder, a VAE learns a probabilistic latent space, which allows it to generate new, realistic-looking images by sampling from this learned distribution.
